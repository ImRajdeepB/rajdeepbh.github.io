My interests include cryptoeconomics, game theory, and product engineering. I like watching cricket, playing basketball, or cooking a dish to keep my sanity.

I work at [BUIDL Labs](https://buidllabs.io), and will graduate from Jamia Hamdard University in fall 2021, majoring in Computer Science.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
